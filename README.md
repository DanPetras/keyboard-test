# Keyboard test
Project was created as a showcase for this [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/37140448/450580).

The problematic flickering can be seen [in this video](docs/keyboard-test.mp4)

Notice how red panel show/hide visibility is out of sync from keybaord show/hide visibility for a slit second when changing the layout.
